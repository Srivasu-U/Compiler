## C-Monkey (Compiled Monkey) v2
- As a reminder, Monkey has three types of statements: `let`, `return` and `expressions`
    - `let` and `return` statements both use the value that is produced
    - `expression` statement is just a wrapper around other expressions so they can occur on their own. The value produced is it not reused
- So, if we end up having a lot of expression statements in a Monkey code snippet like `1; 2; 3;` then, all three values end up on the stack without ever being purged
    - This can cause memory problems since these values must be used
- To solve this, we can explicity tell the VM to pop elements when we estimate that we won't need them in the future
    - Just to make it clear, the way we "tell" the VM anything is through the compiler instructions.
    - This step must also be emitted to ensure proper tracking
    - The opcode for this is `OpPop`
- In order to check if the stack state is correct on the VM, we have to essentially do "Brother VM, this *should* have been on the stack right before this got popped off"
