# The Compiled Monkey Language

- This repo consists of incremental development stages of a compiler for the Monkey programming language, as created through *Writing a Compiler in Go* by Thorsten Ball
- This is a direct extension from the [Interpreter](https://github.com/Srivasu-U/Interpreter), where Monkey was an interpreted language
- Each subdirectory has its own incremental development
    - `interpreted-monkey` is the final stage from the `Interpreter` code. This is the base on which the compiler is started to be built
    - `c-monkey-v1` has the beginnings of a compiler and VM
    - `Notes` has the relevant notes for each subdirectory. Written as I went through each development stage
